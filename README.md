# Monte-Carlo-Particle-Transport-problem-
 Suppose there is one  source which is emitting particles. Then there is a shielding material in front of the source which can scatter or absorb the partciles. Assume arbitrary scattering and absorption cross-section.  After the shielding material, there is a detector which can detect the particle. Now we want to find waht is the probability that the particle emitted from the source will be absorbed. we will use monte carlo techniques to answer this question.<br><br>
