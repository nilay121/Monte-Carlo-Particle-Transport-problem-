# Monte-Carlo-Particle-Transport-problem-
 Suppose there is one  source which is emitting particles. Then there is a shielding material in front of the source which can scatter or absorb the partciles. Assume arbitrary scattering and absorption cross-section.  After the shielding material, there is a detector which can detect the particle
